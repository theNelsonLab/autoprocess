## Description
Autoprocess is a Python script designed to automate the initial steps of MicroED data processing utilizing XDS. The script takes input data files as .ser movies in a specific format, converts them to images, and attempts to index and integrate by XDS independently.

It is designed to be used as a tool that aids in quickly deciding whether data collection should be continued or not, or when learning how to process microED data.
